# Tax-Flow-Back-end 🏡
## Description
Web application for government's commune bureau to help manage taxes on owners of non inhabited lands.

## Functionalities 🛠️
The project’s idea was my teacher’s, which he then proposed to us the basic functionalities :CRUD operations on a relational database schema.
Me and my project partner added other functionalities:My Partner’s : staff management of the commune, with each one with he’s role.Using Spring security to manage staff’s routing.
I added the ability to create taxes, taxe penalties and exonerations automatically after a staff member enters the details of a land amd it’s owner, after that 
the staff can sit and relax and sip his coffee, while the algorithm calculates taxes, adds penalties each month if the taxe is not payed, and exonerate the land owners 
that has the right to, and all of this programmed to run 24/7.

## Modeling 🖍️
Using Java SpringBoot on the backend has separated the application to multiple layers (beans, data access objects, services, web services) makes the application performing 
and easy to manage with the sets of technologies that springboot offers, Spring jpa for the beans, Spring data for the data access objects and finally Spring Rest API that
helps manage the routing of the application.
